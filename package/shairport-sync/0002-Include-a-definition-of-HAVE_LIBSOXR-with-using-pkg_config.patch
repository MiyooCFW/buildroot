Subject: [PATCH] Include a definition of HAVE_LIBSOXR with using pkg_config

Commit e047dee241fe0660d92311a124757065c6c4c93d adds an upstream patch
to fix a build issue with soxr.  The patch also adds detecting soxr
using pkg-config. Upstream detected a config issue [1], where the
resulting binary lacks soxr support, although libsoxr was correctly
detected.
